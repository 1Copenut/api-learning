# api-learning

It's time to learn about APIs and proxies. This is my repo.

## What I&rsquo;ve learned along the way

- Initially I was using [node-fetch](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch) for async data calls. I moved to [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) once I started mocking API calls in test. I&rsquo;m sure there is a way to resolve the [Jest - TypeError: response.json is not a function](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58599735/jest-typeerror-response-json-is-not-a-function) error, but in the interest of time, I pivoted. Switching to Axios allows me to mock API calls quickly, and reason about my data.
